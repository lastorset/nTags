Extends eZ publish's built-in Keywords datatype with configurable predefined
keywords and a multi-tagging UI.

--

Requires eZJSCore. If you want the tag list to be alphabetically sorted
when editing an object, you can install the arraysortoperator extension,
but this is not required.

--

This extension is usable immediately for many sites. Users can tag
any object they own that contains a Keywords attribute. Administrator
users may use the Tags tab to edit the list of predefined tags or tag
multiple objects.

If you wish other users to be able to use the Tags tab, grant them
the ezjscore/ntags permission, and either ntags/multitag or ntags/taglist.

--

Known issues:
- The multitag utility allows tagging objects the user does not own.
- The Tags top-menu item requires "ntags/multitag" permissions to display.
